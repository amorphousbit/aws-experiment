This is an example file for experimenting with how git individually tracks files

I just was renamed to gitfun1renameB AND this line of content was added!!!


Oh! And gitfun1renameB was just changed *after* staging changes. Interesting, eh?
How working directory mods can be segmented from staging for same file, eh?
